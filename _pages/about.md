I am a second-year Master’s student in Information Management with a minor in Data Science at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). Prior to my graduate studies, I led enterprise-wide AI Transformation projects as an AI Product Manager at [Kurly](https://www.kurly.com/), an e-commerce unicorn in Korea. I also served as a PM and cross-functional team lead at [Asleep](https://asleep.ai/), an AI sleep-tech startup, where I managed the 0-to-1 growth of products designed to improve sleep quality.

As a visiting scholar at [Carnegie Mellon University SCS](https://www.scs.cmu.edu/), I was fortunate to work with Professors [Rita Singh](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/faculty/singh-rita.html) and [Bhiksha Raj](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/faculty/raj-bhiksha.html) at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/). I also worked as a research assistant for [Professor Seohyun Jung](https://hss.kaist.ac.kr/boards/view/fulltime_professor_en/91) at [KAIST HSS](https://hss.kaist.ac.kr/), exploring metaverse environments and narrative theory.

My professional philosophy is deeply rooted in Human-Centered Design, which I cultivated during my undergraduate studies in Industrial Design (UX/UI) at [Kookmin University](https://www.kookmin.ac.kr/). I am passionate about translating complex data and technology into sustainable, global solutions that fundamentally address challenges in healthcare and mental health.
